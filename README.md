#Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The inventroy tracking app developed was designed with user authentication to ensure only end users with a user-id and password could access and make changes to the data. After acessign the app, end users have the ability to adjust the database by adding, removing, and increasing/decreasing inventory within the database. The user is also notified through the application when an item in the inventory falls below zero with the addition of a radio button within the application settings menu. The applications represents the inventory throuhgh a grid view.

#What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

There are four primary screens within the application that include the login, grid view inventory display, notifications, settings, along with an add items. In developing the UI, screens were designed with the user in mind through consistent themes using green and blue color. The application has a good flow for ease of use and adheres by Android core application quality standards. 


#How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

With my coding process, I began with incorporating the many features required, but soon learned that this set me back, so I took a different approcah and begin developing specifc features like notifications and the users menu. This helped me in pursuit of completing the app and I will take what I've learned here into future projects.

#How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

Using the Android IDK, i tested often with various emulated devices and with the various screens. Testing is an important aspect to my approach. Working with various devices will help ensure the application has the ability to work on multiple devices.

#Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

To begin, there were alot of elements to this application to bring all together and I faced challenges with flow. The notification screen was initially set up and it took soem time to get it to work with the menu. Through further research I was able to create a switch. 


#In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The main component I had success in developing was the user authentication login screen. My past experince with SQL, mySQL, and noSQL helped and I feel confident in future projects where I can pair various programming languages and database integration.
